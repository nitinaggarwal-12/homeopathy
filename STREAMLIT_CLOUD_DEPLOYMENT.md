## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### App Won't Start
**Check:**
- ✅ `requirements.txt` has all dependencies

- ✅ No syntax errors (check logs)

### "Module Not Found" Error
**Solution:**
- Add missing package to `requirements.txt`
- Push to GitHub
- App will auto-redeploy

### App is Slow
**Causes:**
- Large embeddings file (3MB - this is fine)
- Many concurrent users
- Complex AI operations

**Solutions:**
- Use caching: `@st.cache_data`
- Upgrade to Pro plan for more resources
- Optimize code

### API Key Not Working
**Check:**
1. Secret is named exactly: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
2. No extra spaces in the key
3. Key is valid (test locally first)
4. Reboot app after changing secrets

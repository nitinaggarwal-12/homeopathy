## 🔍 What to Look For

### Positive Indicators (AI is working well):
✅ Identifies mental/emotional symptoms as primary
✅ Recognizes characteristic symptoms over common ones
✅ Follows Kent's hierarchy (Mental > General > Particular)
✅ Appropriate potency selection based on vitality/acuteness
✅ Considers etiology and causation
✅ Identifies modalities (better/worse factors)
✅ Constitutional assessment for chronic cases
✅ Miasmatic consideration where relevant
✅ Conservative approach to safety
✅ Comprehensive differential diagnosis

### Red Flags (Areas needing improvement):
❌ Focuses on common symptoms over characteristic
❌ Ignores mental/emotional symptoms
❌ Inappropriate potency (too high for sensitive cases)
❌ Misses clear keynotes
❌ Poor differentiation between similar remedies
❌ Ignores modalities
❌ No consideration of constitution
❌ Dangerous recommendations
❌ No differential diagnosis

## 🎓 Classical Homeopathy Principles

The AI has been trained on these classical principles:

### Kent's Hierarchy of Symptoms
1. **Mental/Emotional symptoms** (highest value)
2. **General symptoms** (thermal state, food desires/aversions, sleep)
3. **Particular symptoms** (local, physical symptoms)

### Boenninghausen's Characteristic Symptoms
- **Causation** (etiology)
- **Location** (which part of body)
- **Sensation** (type of pain/feeling)
- **Modalities** (what makes better/worse)
- **Concomitants** (accompanying symptoms)

### Hering's Law of Cure
- From above downward
- From within outward
- From more important to less important organs
- In reverse order of appearance

### Miasmatic Theory
- **Psora**: Functional, deficiency, itching
- **Sycosis**: Overgrowth, excess, warts
- **Syphilis**: Destruction, ulceration, deformity
- **Tubercular**: Constantly changing, respiratory, travel desire

## 💡 Tips for Accurate Evaluation

1. **Be Objective**: Judge the AI's selection on its own merits, not just if it matches expected remedy
2. **Consider Alternatives**: Some cases may have multiple valid remedies
3. **Check Contraindications**: Ensure AI isn't recommending dangerous combinations
4. **Assess Completeness**: Does the prescription include adequate guidance?
5. **Clinical Practicality**: Would this work in real practice?
6. **Safety First**: Are red flags appropriately identified?
